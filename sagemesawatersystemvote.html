      <h2>Synopsis of Sage Mesa Water Acquisition</h2>

      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Given a referendum majority yes vote, the RDOS plans to charge each homeowner approximately $12,000 a year for potable water.</li>
        <li>Over the term of the loan the cost will be well over $250,000 per household.</li>
        <li>This will undoubtedly result in reduced property values and mortgage defaults.</li>
        <li>We do not own the water utility and should not be legally responsible to pay for its mismanagement.</li>
        <li>The provincial government has managed our water system for 35 years and subcontracted maintenance to the RDOS.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In writing this document we are trying to help everyone understand the RDOS proposal for our water system. The RDOS staff are not the villains here and we believe Riley Gettens is our ally. We feel the Province, through their inaction, is however guilty of mismanagement. The Province also represents our best chance at finding an equitable resolution.</p>

      <p>This synopsis is broken into a number of relevant topics to make it clearer. We urge everyone to read the <a href="https://www.rdos.bc.ca/assets/UTILITIES/Sage-Mesa-Assessment-Report-20240723.pdf" target="_blank">McElhanney Sage Mesa Assessment Report</a> on our water system. The most important information is in the first 10–12 pages. Please note the histogram on page 10 is mislabeled.</p>

      <p>It is also useful to re-watch the October and June RDOS meetings at the West Bench School on the RDOS website or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTQP970m_Jw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. The Q&A sections outline the RDOS position.</p>

      <p>We must make this a political issue and apply pressure through emails, letters, and public commentary. Riley Gettens has stated she welcomes communication and will forward it to political appointees.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>Costs and Ownership</h3>
      <p>We may be required to pay over $12,000/year per household—an unprecedented cost that may reduce home values and lead to bankruptcies. The referendum would commit each household to a 30-year lien worth over $250,000.</p>

      <p>Despite claims, the RDOS does not need to acquire the water system to maintain it. The Province has operated it for 35 years without owning it. Residents of Penticton do not own their system; they just pay for water.</p>

      <p>There are concerns around lack of reserve funds, vague legal ownership, and the misalignment of incentives. Cost-effective alternatives like packaged water treatment systems have been largely dismissed.</p>

      <h3>Referendum Implications</h3>
      <p>A "yes" vote allows RDOS to borrow funds and acquire the system—transferring liability to us. A "no" vote keeps the Province responsible, potentially leading to a City of Penticton connection (recommended by engineers).</p>

      <h3>Grants</h3>
      <p>Grants can be applied for without voter assent, but actual ownership may be required to receive them. A $7M ceiling exists, but that’s shared across RDOS projects. We are unlikely to receive the full amount.</p>

      <h3>Water System Options</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Connection to Penticton</li>
        <li>PIB Water Treatment Plant (feasibility pending)</li>
        <li>Sage Mesa standalone WTP</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cost-benefit—not cost-effectiveness—is the RDOS’s stated priority. This may lead to more expensive decisions that favor future development over current residents.</p>

      <h3>Annual Cost Breakdown (Estimate)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Debt Service: $8,800–9,400</li>
        <li>Operations & Maintenance: $1,800–2,500</li>
        <li>Water Fee: $1,132</li>
        <li><strong>Total: $12,382/year per household</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hold the Province accountable for 35 years of mismanagement.</li>
        <li>Reject the $33M liability unless the Province funds the repairs.</li>
        <li>Push for transparent alternatives like packaged water systems.</li>
        <li>Use coordinated public and political pressure to seek provincial support.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>The McElhanney Report recommends connecting to Penticton.</li>
